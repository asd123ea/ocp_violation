Simple OCP project 
==============================================

### PROJECT ###
The project is about having some different shape classes, which should be listed in some specific order.

Branch feature/ocp_violated contains code which solves the problem without considering ocp principle.

Branch master contains code which solves the problem observing ocp principle.

It's just a simple example I took from a book, which I can refer in future conversations.
